      <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gaming
          <p>
            This is my main hobby. Whenever I have free time, I always play
            different games to pass the time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Playing Guitar
          <p>
            This is my second hobby/interest. It always fascinates me whenever I
            try and learn new songs that it has different ways to play a song.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Watching anime
          <p>
            This is also another way of me to pass time. It is also interesting
            that there is always a new anime showing every few months.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Eating
          <p>Everybody loves eating, me included.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Volleyball
          <p>
            Exercising is a good way to stay healthy. The same as playing
            sports, volleyball is my favorite sports at the moment.
