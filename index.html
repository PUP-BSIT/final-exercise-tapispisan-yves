      <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gaming
          <p>
            This is my main hobby. Whenever I have free time, I always play
            different games to pass the time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Playing Guitar
          <p>
            This is my second hobby/interest. It always fascinates me whenever I
            try and learn new songs that it has different ways to play a song.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Watching anime
          <p>
            This is also another way of me to pass time. It is also interesting
            that there is always a new anime showing every few months.

        </li>
        <li>
          Volleyball
          <p>
            Exercising is a good way to stay healthy. The same as playing
            sports, volleyball is my favorite sports at the moment.

      <h2>My Journal</h2>
      <p>
        My college life is not exactly all ups, there are also many downs.
        As life should be, not everything will be in the way that I like.
        This is the path that I choose and I will continue to walk through
        the end of this path. Playing games is one of my hobby and it always
        fascinates me whenever I play one. "How do these character moves?", 
        "Look at this scene, it looks beautiful", "How do they make this?" 
        These are some of the question I used to say when I was a kid playing
        a video game. And now that I have experience making one myself for 
        a project in one of our subject. I'll say that it is pretty interesting. 
        From the creation of characters, learning to making them move, where 
        they will move, what action will they make when they hit an item and 
        everything else. Its still feels like magic to me, that me and my 
        groupmates made a game. Albeit a simple one, we still made a game. 
        I want to continue in this path and see where would I be in the future.
